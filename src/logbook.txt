// @todo Rotation retrievement is wrong!!!

// @todo The way im doing this, it only gathers joints/bones that are directly affecting the mes
	// so joints that have influence over it. The root isnt supposed to have any direct influence 
	// over the mesh, but I needed so. Im gonna have a reference to the root node store somewhere
	// Maybe when retrieving the first node with any influence, which hierarchically is the nearest
	// one to the root... Maybe do that? 
	// Another solution, would be that the root joint had a really tiny tiny influence over some vertex??? Nah
